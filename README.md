#Artemis Arquillian

Artemis Arquillian is an implementation of A JBoss Arquillian Container that allows you to write tests without having to 
programmatically start a broker. It decouples the creation and running of the broker from the test itself so you can write 
and develop tests to run that can run in different environments, single machine, multiple bare metal or Cloiud environments. 

There are 2 deployable containers Local and Remote.
